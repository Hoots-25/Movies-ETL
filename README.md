# Movies-ETL

# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to utilize the Extract, Transform, & Load (ETL) method to create databases of clean movie data. 

The data was extracted from three sources: Wikipedia, Kaggle, and IMDB ratings. The data was cleaned and transformed before it was merged into consolidated databses for movies and ratings.
